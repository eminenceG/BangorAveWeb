# Project 3 - API Prototype

This is a prototype to test getting data from the API. We planned to use three external API sources in project 3:

| API        | Reference |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| USAJOBS      | https://developer.usajobs.gov |
| NewsAPI     | https://newsapi.org/docs      |  
| Google Maps | https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/      |  

For this assignment we only focus on front end interface to interact with APIs. Several routes are implemented:

|route | Functions |
|----|:----:|
| ```/jobs```| Search jobs; Show top 10 results|
| ```/news```| Search news; Show a list of results|
|```/job/detail/:jobId```| Show job detail, news related to the organization and map of job location |

Other features such as login, register, user profiles are not included in this release.

Special thanks to USAJOBS, NewsAPI and Google Maps for sharing their high quality APIs!
